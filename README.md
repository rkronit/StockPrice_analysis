Stock price analysis of google and tesla using data from yfinance 
This project focuses on applying various time series forecasting models to predict the closing prices of Tesla and Google stocks. The primary objective is to evaluate and compare different models to determine which performs best for each stock. The project uses historical stock data for a one-year period (December 1, 2023, to December 1, 2024) sourced from Yahoo
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the stock price data for analysis.
Model Implementation: Implement various time series forecasting models, including:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
AutoReg (Auto Regression)
Model Evaluation: Compare the performance of the models based on metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and visualization of predictions.
Visualization: Plot actual vs. predicted values to visually assess model accuracy.
Conclusion: Determine the best forecasting model for Tesla and Google stocks based on quantitative and qualitative results.
This project demonstrates the application of statistical models for time series forecasting of stock prices. By comparing ARIMA, SARIMA, and AutoReg, we identified the best models for Tesla and Google stocks, providing insights into their predictive accuracy and practical use cases.
